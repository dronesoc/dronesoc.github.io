      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jashan is your treasurer. He is currently in his 4th year, studying Computer Science with Embedded Systems. He&amp;rsquo;s had an interest in remote control stuff for a while, but only really got into it when he designed and built his first quadcopter a couple of years ago. He&amp;rsquo;s interested in 3D printing (which is how he built his first quad!), and more generally anything that incorporates technology and moves&amp;hellip; the latest example of this being Robot Wars, in which he was lucky enough to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infernalcontraption.co.uk&#34;&gt;participate in the new series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sean is a fourth year student studying Computer Science MEng. He became interested in drones a few years ago after watching videos by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/flitetest&#34;&gt;Flite Test&lt;/a&gt; and now owns a total of six quadcopters, three of which were self-built. You can see some of his drone-related adventures on his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WZ_1nNi4fiK7X7NN0_wBA&#34;&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. His favourite drone pilot is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIxOhfoGM0&#34;&gt;Mr Steele&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sam is the first president of DroneSoc, which he maintains seemed like a good idea at the time. When he&amp;rsquo;s not flying he studies Computer Science, juggles a multitude of hare-brained programming and electronics projects, and tries to keep the technology from exploding at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ystv.co.uk&#34;&gt;YSTV&lt;/a&gt;. His favourite text editor is Vim, and he is a big fan of third person biographies. He can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/swlcx&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
